- Enter feedback below, we can format it later to look cleaner for the presentation. We should try and make them sound like user stories.

Users want to be able to search courses by the course name and not just the course code. 
- In this instance the user tried to search for "bee bio" without knowning the course code (which was ENVS and not BIO) and was unable to locate and add the course. 
+ See branch 'typeahead-bytitle' for solution.

Users want to be able to view exam information for courses.
- In this instance the user really liked the website however they thought it would be useful for the user if exam information was also readily available.
- we were not able to implement this as we already reached our weights for the sprint and it was not feasible for the time left.

Users would like to view course information while hovering over courses added in schedule.
- In this instance the particular user is interested in knowing more information about the course.
- We have implemented a display of course name, professor, lecture room, semester taken and campus when mouse hovering over the courses.

Users would like a tooltip helper that explains functionality of the buttons on the webpage
- The user liked the course information that popped up once they hovered a over a course, but it took some trial and error to get there
- The user wasn't aware that you had to hit "load courses" after entering courses, as it prompted them to only enter a single one
