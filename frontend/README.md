## REACT APP

These instructions are for react developers on their individual machines. You are not meant to develop in react on the google compute engine itself, only push completed builds there.

This app was kickstarted using [create-react-app](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started) and has [bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) embedded for CSS.

## Run instructions

[Install node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and follow directions for your operating system.

**In the frontend folder install dependencies for our project:**

### `curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_16.x | sudo -E bash -`

**To run in development mode and make live changes, type:**

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.


**For interactive testing:**

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

**To create a working build that can be copied to the server:**

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
