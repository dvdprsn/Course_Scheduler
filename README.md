# **COURSE INFORMATION SEARCH PROGRAM**

### **DESCRIPTION**
A program that allows the user to search for a particular course in the University of Guelph's Fall 2022 course catalog,
and obtain a variety of related information, such as the following: status, section name and title, location, meeting 
information, faculty, available spots, capacity, credits, and academic level. Through the use of a CLI tool,
the user is able to search for their desired course information, which is stored in a local csv file that is generated by 
the initial parsing script. For more guidance on the usage of the program, please see the *USAGE INSTRUCTIONS* section below.
